                        <img class="icons" src="icons/icons8-musical-notes-100.png"> discography page on my website</button>
                </form>
                <p style="font-size: 14px;">the first link is my bandcamp, where all of my released music is. the second link is the discography page on my personal website (katsumashi.com), where I go into more detail about the songs.<br><br>
                I am primarily a musician. the Katsumashi name actually refers to the music project, but I use it in so many places it's also my username. note: it is not my actual name.<br><br>
                the Katsumashi music project is a combination of a lot of different genres: 
                    bedroom pop & post-rock are the two big ones, but there are a lot of other influences in my music, namely indie rock, indie folk, progressive metal, & ambient, among others.
                the general idea of a lot of my music is this genre I made up called "post-pop" which centres around balancing typical pop melodies and song structure with the long, layered compositions of post-rock. <br><br>
                that sounds pretentious, but essentially it's just bedroom pop/rock but half the songs are 12 minutes long and 6 of those minutes are a big crescendo or whatever</p>

                        <img class="icons" src="icons/icons8-globe-100.png"> links/socials page</button> 
                </form>
                <p style="font-size: 14px;">this is a page I designed and built in about four hours using html/css (no javascript aside from the auto-updating age)<br><br>
                I made it to house all my social links, websites, music, etc. it replaced my carrd.co page which was essentially the same thing, except hosted on a different site<br><br>
                I knew zero html/css before making this, aside from the very basics like bold and italics and how to lay out a document. 
                    I did know a little javascript, but aside from that I taught myself how to make, and also made, the website in those four hours. 
                    I tweaked it to fix some issues the day after.<br><br>
                this website you are currently reading uses the same CSS stylesheet as that website.</p>
